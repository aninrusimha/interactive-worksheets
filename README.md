# Interactive Worksheets
A platform for developing online worksheets with interactive problems. To be used in the [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/) club at UC Berkeley for the [CS70](http://www.eecs70.org/) class.


## Setting Up
```bash
npm install
```

## Development
Run `npm run dev` to set up a local server. Hot reloading is currently not supported for the TeX sources, so you'll need to reload when changing those.

## Releasing
To publish a production build of the worksheets site, run `npm run export`.
